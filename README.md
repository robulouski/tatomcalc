Trade-A-Tron-O-Matic Calc
=========================

The Trade-A-Tron-O-Matic Calculator -- a simple position sizing calculator.
Perfect for traders who can't be bothered starting up Excel and typing in
formulas!

If you don't know what position sizing is then you probably don't need this
application.  If you consider yourself a stock market trader and you don't
know what position sizing is, you should probably consider reading Van
Tharp.

Trade-A-Tron-O-Matic Calc is an open-source cross-platform desktop
application written in Python with PySide Qt bindings, so it should run on
any OS with Python, Qt and PySide installed.  Just grab the source code,
put it anywhere, then run tatomcalc.py.  There is no configuration or
registry entries required.

Alternatively, [binaries for some systems may be 
avalailable here.](http://www.voidynullness.net/page/position-sizing-calculator/)
